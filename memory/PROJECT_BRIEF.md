# PROJECT BRIEF - CollabCanvas

**Last Updated:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** MVP Complete ✅ | AI Agent Complete ✅ | Documentation Complete ✅ | Ready for Submission 🚀

---

## 🎯 Core Mission

Real-time collaborative whiteboard application where multiple users can simultaneously draw, create shapes, and manipulate canvas elements through natural language AI commands. Built with Next.js, tldraw, Firebase, and OpenAI GPT-4.

---

## 📦 Product Overview

**What it is:**
- Infinite collaborative canvas with 60 FPS pan/zoom performance
- Multi-user real-time synchronization (cursors + shapes)
- AI-powered canvas agent "Flippy" 🥞 for natural language manipulation
- Production-grade authentication, presence awareness, and error handling

**Target Users:**
- Teams needing real-time collaborative diagramming
- Designers prototyping UI layouts
- Educators building visual content
- Anyone needing quick visual brainstorming

**Key Differentiator:**
AI-first canvas manipulation - users can create complex UI layouts (login forms, nav bars, grids) with simple text commands instead of manual drawing.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Summary

**Frontend:**
- Next.js 15.5.5 (App Router, Server Components)
- tldraw 4.0.3 (infinite canvas library)
- TypeScript 5 (strict mode)
- Tailwind CSS 4

**Backend:**
- Firebase Authentication (Anonymous + Google Sign-In)
- Firebase Realtime Database (cursor positions, presence)
- Cloud Firestore (shape persistence)
- Server-side API proxy for OpenAI

**AI Layer:**
- OpenAI GPT-4 Turbo with function calling
- 10 canvas manipulation commands (creation, manipulation, layout, complex UI)
- Server-side proxy ✔ (API key location: `.env.local`)
- Rate limiting: disabled for dev, ready for production

## 🔐 Security & Configuration

**Environment Variables:**
- ✔ Firebase config (7 vars): `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*`
- ✔ OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_API_KEY` (server-side only, no NEXT_PUBLIC prefix)
- ✔ tldraw license: `NEXT_PUBLIC_TLDRAW_LICENSE_KEY` (optional)

**Security Rules:**
- ✔ Firestore: Authenticated read/write with field validation
- ✔ Realtime DB: Per-user write, all authenticated read
- ✔ API proxy: Server-side only, no client exposure

**Secrets Status:**
- API keys: ✔ Located in `.env.local` (gitignored)
- Firebase config: ✔ Public (expected for Firebase client SDK)
- OpenAI key: ✔ Server-side only (never exposed to client)

3. ✅ Memory bank system (5 structured files)

**Next Steps:**
1. Final pre-submission verification (tests, build, deployment)
2. Submit project with all deliverables

**Known Limitations:**
- Image assets don't persist (requires Firebase Storage)
- Single default room (multi-room planned)
- No mobile optimization yet
- Rate limiting disabled for development
