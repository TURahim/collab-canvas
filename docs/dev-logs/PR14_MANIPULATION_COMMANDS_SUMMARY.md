# PR #14: Manipulation Commands - Summary

## Overview
Implemented `moveShape` and `transformShape` commands with position keywords, target selection, and comprehensive transformations (resize, rotate, scale).

## Features Implemented

### 1. Move Shape Command (`moveShape`)
**File:** `src/lib/canvasTools.ts`

**Features:**
- Move shapes to numeric coordinates (x, y)
- Position keywords: `center`, `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom`
- Target selection: `selected`, `all`, or specific shape ID
- Moves multiple shapes when target is `all`
- Automatically centers shapes at target position

**Example Commands:**
- "Move selected shape to center"
- "Put it on the left side"
- "Move to x=500, y=300"
- "Move all shapes to the top"

### 2. Transform Shape Command (`transformShape`)
**File:** `src/lib/canvasTools.ts`

**Features:**
- Resize shapes (width, height)
- Rotate shapes (degrees, converted to radians)
- Scale shapes (multiplier, e.g., 1.5 for 150%)
- Combine multiple transformations in one command
- Target selection: `selected` or specific shape ID

**Example Commands:**
- "Make it bigger" → scale: 1.5
- "Rotate 45 degrees"
- "Resize to 300x200"
- "Scale down by half" → scale: 0.5

### 3. Helper Functions

#### `getTargetShapes(editor, target)`
- Resolves target parameter to array of shapes
- Supports: "selected", "all", or shape ID
- Throws descriptive errors when shapes not found

#### `calculatePosition(editor, x, y)`
- Converts position keywords to numeric coordinates
- Supports: "center", "left", "right", "top", "bottom"
- Allows mixing keywords and numbers (e.g., x=250, y="top")
- Defaults to center when undefined

## Integration

### FloatingChat Component
**File:** `src/components/FloatingChat.tsx`

- Added `moveShape` and `transformShape` imports
- Integrated both commands in function call switch
- Added descriptive success messages:
  - moveShape: "✅ Moved 1 shape (selected) to center, center"
  - transformShape: "✅ Transformed 1 shape: size: 300x200, rotation: 45°"

### AI Service Route
**File:** `src/app/api/ai/execute/route.ts`

- Function schemas already defined (from earlier setup)
- `moveShape` schema with target, x, y parameters
- `transformShape` schema with target, width, height, rotation, scale parameters
- Flippy's system prompt already includes manipulation commands

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
**File:** `src/lib/__tests__/manipulationTools.test.ts`

**Test Coverage: 34 tests, all passing ✅**

#### `getTargetShapes` (6 tests)
- ✅ Return selected shapes
- ✅ Return all shapes
- ✅ Return specific shape by ID
- ✅ Error when no selection
- ✅ Error when shape not found
- ✅ Error when editor is null

#### `calculatePosition` (8 tests)
- ✅ Numeric coordinates
- ✅ Center keyword
- ✅ Left, right, top, bottom keywords
- ✅ Default to center when undefined
- ✅ Mix numeric and keyword positions

#### `moveShape` (8 tests)
- ✅ Move to numeric coordinates
- ✅ Move to center keyword
- ✅ Move to left position
- ✅ Move multiple shapes (all)
- ✅ Move specific shape by ID
- ✅ Error handling
- ✅ Default position behavior

#### `transformShape` (12 tests)
- ✅ Resize with width/height
- ✅ Rotate by degrees (45°, 90°, 180°)
- ✅ Scale up and down
- ✅ Combine transformations
- ✅ Transform specific shape by ID
- ✅ Partial transformations (width only, height only)
- ✅ Error handling

## Technical Details

### Position Keyword Mapping
- **center**: Viewport center (x: centerX, y: centerY)
- **left**: 100px from left edge
- **right**: 100px from right edge (width - 100)
- **top**: 100px from top edge
- **bottom**: 100px from bottom edge (height - 100)

### Rotation Conversion
- Input: Degrees (user-friendly)
- Internal: Radians (tldraw requirement)
- Formula: `radians = (degrees * Math.PI) / 180`

### Shape Types Supported
- **Geo shapes**: rectangle, ellipse, triangle
  - Resize using `props.w` and `props.h`
  - Rotation using shape-level `rotation` property
- **Text shapes**: Not modified by transformShape (future enhancement)
- **Arrow shapes**: Not modified by transformShape (future enhancement)

## Build Status

✅ **Build successful**
- 0 errors
- Only pre-existing warnings (`any` types in other files)
- All 34 manipulation tests passing
- All integration points working

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/lib/canvasTools.ts` - Added 4 functions (~230 lines)
2. ✅ `src/components/FloatingChat.tsx` - Added command handlers
3. ✅ `src/lib/__tests__/manipulationTools.test.ts` - 34 comprehensive tests
4. ✅ `src/types/ai.ts` - Types already defined

## Example Usage

### Move Commands
```
User: "Move the selected shape to the center"
Flippy: "Oh, you want it centered? How creative. Let me do that for you..."
Result: ✅ Moved 1 shape (selected) to center, center

User: "Put all shapes on the left"
Flippy: "Left side it is. Because symmetry is overrated, right?"
Result: ✅ Moved 3 shapes (all) to left, center
```

### Transform Commands
```
User: "Make it bigger"
Flippy: "Bigger? How much bigger? Fine, I'll scale it 1.5x..."
Result: ✅ Transformed 1 shape: scale: 1.5x

User: "Rotate 45 degrees"
Flippy: "45 degrees of unnecessary rotation coming right up..."
Result: ✅ Transformed 1 shape: rotation: 45°

User: "Resize to 300 by 200"
Flippy: "Oh wow, specific dimensions. Someone's feeling fancy today..."
Result: ✅ Transformed 1 shape: size: 300x200
```

## Next Steps

PR #14 is complete! Ready for:
1. ✅ User testing in the UI
2. ✅ Moving on to PR #15 (Layout Commands - `arrangeShapes`, `createGrid`)
