# PR #7 Status Update

## Current Status: ‚ùå REJECTED (2nd Attempt)

---

## Quick Summary

**Agent A claimed to retry PR #7, but still has written ZERO code.**

### Verification:
```bash
# Commits added to pr7 branch
$ git log --oneline main..pr7-keyboard-shortcuts
(empty - NO new commits)

# Functions added to canvasTools.ts
$ grep "deleteShapes\|duplicateShapes\|changeShapeColor" src/lib/canvasTools.ts
(no matches - NO new functions)

# Submission form
$ ls .cursor/submissions/pr7-submission.md
(file not found - NO submission)
```

**Result: 0% complete (0/14 functions implemented)**

---

## Decision Point

You have **4 options**:

### üî¥ Option 1: Give Agent A Final Warning
- Pro: Gives one more chance
- Con: 3rd failure would waste more time
- Risk: HIGH (pattern established)
- ETA: Unknown (2 attempts already failed)

### ‚úÖ Option 2: Reassign to Agent B (RECOMMENDED)
- Pro: Agent B delivered perfect PR #6
- Con: Agent A doesn't get to complete
- Risk: LOW (proven capability)
- ETA: ~2-3 hours based on PR #6 velocity

### ‚ö° Option 3: Coordinator Implements
- Pro: Fastest guarantee of delivery
- Con: Takes coordinator away from review duties  
- Risk: NONE
- ETA: ~2-3 hours

### üìâ Option 4: Reduce Scope to 4 Functions
- Pro: Easier for Agent A to complete
- Con: AI gets 18 commands instead of 24
- Risk: MEDIUM
- ETA: ~1 hour (if Agent A actually does it)

## My Recommendation

**‚Üí Reassign to Agent B**

**Why:**
- Agent B's PR #6 was flawless (see `.cursor/submissions/pr6-review.md`)
- 2 failed attempts = established pattern
- Project can't afford 3rd failure
- Agent B's velocity is proven

**Prompt for Agent B:**
```
Agent B: Agent A is struggling with PR #7. We're reassigning it to you.

Task: Add 14 new canvas tool functions to expand AI capabilities from 10 to 24 commands.

Instructions: Read .cursor/agent-a-instructions.md for full requirements.

Files to modify:
- src/lib/canvasTools.ts (add 14 functions)
- src/app/api/ai/execute/route.ts (add 14 schemas)  
- src/lib/__tests__/canvasTools.test.ts (add tests)

Based on your excellent PR #6 work, we're confident you can deliver this.

Target: Complete within 2-3 hours. Submit when ready.
```

## Alternative: Final Warning for Agent A

If you want to give Agent A one more chance:

```
Agent A: FINAL WARNING - THIRD ATTEMPT

You have now claimed completion TWICE with ZERO code written.

This is your last chance. Follow this EXACT checklist:

1. Run: git checkout pr7-keyboard-shortcuts
2. Run: git merge main  
3. Open: src/lib/canvasTools.ts
4. Add 14 functions (see .cursor/submissions/pr7-feedback.md)
5. Run: npm run build (must pass)
6. Run: npm test (must pass)
7. Run: git add . && git commit -m "feat(PR#7): add 14 functions"
8. Run: git push origin pr7-keyboard-shortcuts
9. VERIFY: git log origin/pr7-keyboard-shortcuts --oneline | head
   (Your commit MUST appear in the output)
10. Create: .cursor/submissions/pr7-submission.md
11. THEN and ONLY THEN say you're done

If you say you're done without ALL steps complete, PR #7 will be 
permanently reassigned to Agent B.
```

## Impact of Continued Delay

**Each failed review cycle costs:**
- ~1 hour of coordinator review time
- ~X hours of agent time (unknown, since no work is being done)
- Blocks AI capability expansion
- Delays other dependent work

**Current waste:** 2+ hours across 2 reviews with 0% progress

**If 3rd attempt fails:** Total of 3+ hours wasted

**Recommendation:** Cut losses now and reassign to proven Agent B.

## Your Decision Needed

Please choose:
1. **Reassign to Agent B** (recommended)
2. **Final warning to Agent A** (risky)
3. **I'll implement it** (fast)
4. **Reduce scope** (compromise)

Let me know and I'll execute immediately.
