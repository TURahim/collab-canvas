# Multi-Agent Development System: Coordinating AI Agents with a Merge Coordinator

**How to Scale Development with Parallel AI Agents and Automated Integration**

---

## The Challenge

Modern software development often involves multiple features being built simultaneously. When working with AI coding assistants like Cursor or Claude Code, coordinating parallel development streams presents unique challenges:

- **Context Isolation**: Each AI agent needs clear boundaries for its work
- **Merge Conflicts**: Multiple agents modifying the same codebase creates integration headaches
- **Quality Control**: Who ensures all pieces work together?
- **Coordination Overhead**: How do agents communicate progress and blockers?

This article presents a practical system for coordinating multiple AI agents building features in parallel, with a specialized "Merge Coordinator" agent responsible for integration.

## System Architecture

### The Three-Role Model

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐

└───────┼────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────┘
        │            │              │              │
        │            └──────┬───────┴──────┬───────┘

        │                   │             │
        │                   │  Submits    │  Submits
        │                   │  Work       │  Work
        │                   │             │
        │            ┌──────▼─────────────▼────────┐
        └────────────┤   Merge Coordinator Agent   │
                     │  (Reviews, Tests, Merges)   │
                     └─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Three Distinct Roles:**

1. **Development Agents** (A & B): Build features independently on separate branches
2. **Merge Coordinator**: Reviews, tests, and integrates work from development agents
3. **Orchestrator** (You): Assigns work and monitors overall progress

### Why This Works

- **Parallel Development**: Two agents work simultaneously without stepping on each other's toes
- **Clear Ownership**: Each agent has specific features and branches
- **Quality Gate**: Merge Coordinator ensures nothing broken reaches main
- **Structured Communication**: Standardized submission forms prevent miscommunication
- **Separation of Concerns**: Building ≠ Integrating (different skills, different agents)

---

## Implementation: A Real-World Example

Let's walk through implementing this system for a collaborative canvas application that needs four new features:

1. **Room Settings UI** (PR #5)
2. **Export to PNG/SVG** (PR #6)
3. **Keyboard Shortcuts** (PR #7)
4. **Text Styling Panel** (PR #8)

### Prerequisites (CONFIRMED COMPLETE)

Before starting the multi-agent workflow, the following foundation work was completed:

✅ **PR #1**: Multi-room routing (`/rooms` and `/room/[roomId]`)  
✅ **PR #2**: Room metadata in Firestore (`/rooms/{id}/metadata`)  
✅ **PR #3**: Room-scoped presence and shapes  
✅ **PR #4**: Multi-room synchronization and integration testing

**The application is ready for parallel feature development.** Agents can start work immediately.

### Phase 1: Setup Infrastructure (30 minutes)

#### Create Branch Structure

```bash
# Ensure you're on latest main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create isolated branches for each feature
git checkout -b pr5-room-ui
git push -u origin pr5-room-ui

git checkout main
git checkout -b pr6-export-png
git push -u origin pr6-export-png

git checkout main
git checkout -b pr7-keyboard-shortcuts
git push -u origin pr7-keyboard-shortcuts

git checkout main
git checkout -b pr8-text-styling
git push -u origin pr8-text-styling

# Return to main
git checkout main

# Create submissions directory
mkdir -p .cursor/submissions
```

**IMPORTANT**: Create backup branches before starting merges (merge coordinator will do this):
```bash
git checkout pr5-room-ui && git branch pr5-backup
git checkout pr6-export-png && git branch pr6-backup
git checkout pr7-keyboard-shortcuts && git branch pr7-backup
git checkout pr8-text-styling && git branch pr8-backup
git checkout main
```

#### Create Agent Instruction Files

The key to coordinating multiple AI agents is giving each one a **persistent instruction file** that defines its role, responsibilities, and workflow.

**`.cursor/agent-a-instructions.md`**

```markdown
# Agent A: Room UI & Keyboard Shortcuts

## Your Responsibilities
- **PR #5**: Room Settings & Permissions UI
- **PR #7**: Keyboard Shortcuts

## Branch Assignment
- PR #5: `pr5-room-ui`
- PR #7: `pr7-keyboard-shortcuts`

## Workflow
1. Switch to assigned branch before starting work
2. Complete PR according to specifications
3. Run tests: `pnpm test` and `pnpm build`
4. Fill out PR submission form
5. Submit to Merge Coordinator

## PR Submission Template
When complete, create: `.cursor/submissions/pr{N}-submission.md`

### Required Sections:
- **Status Checklist**: Implementation, tests, build, lint
- **Files Changed**: Complete list
- **Dependencies Added**: Any new packages
- **Breaking Changes**: None or detailed list
- **Testing Instructions**: Step-by-step
- **Integration Notes**: Dependencies on other PRs, potential conflicts
- **Screenshots/Demo**: For UI changes

## Current Task
- Status: [Not Started / In Progress / Complete]
- Active Branch: [branch name]
- Next Steps: [what to do next]
```

**`.cursor/agent-b-instructions.md`**

Similar structure but responsible for PR #6 (Export) and PR #8 (Text Styling).

**`.cursor/merge-coordinator-instructions.md`**

```markdown
# Merge Coordinator: Integration Manager

## Your Responsibilities
1. Review PR submissions from Agent A and B
2. Check for conflicts between branches
3. Run integration tests
4. Merge PRs in optimal order
5. Resolve any merge conflicts
6. Ensure main branch stays stable

## Workflow

### Step 1: Review Submission
When you receive a PR submission:

1. **Checklist Verification**
   - All checkboxes marked complete
   - Files changed list is comprehensive
   - Testing instructions are clear

2. **Branch Inspection**
   ```bash
   git checkout pr{N}-branch-name
   pnpm install
   pnpm test
   pnpm build
   pnpm lint
   ```

3. **Code Review**
   - Check for code quality issues
   - Verify follows project patterns
   - Look for security concerns

### Step 2: Conflict Detection
```bash
# Check for conflicts with main
git checkout pr{N}-branch-name
git merge-base HEAD origin/main
git diff origin/main...HEAD

# Check for conflicts with other pending PRs
git diff pr{other-N}-branch-name...HEAD
```

### Step 3: Integration Testing
```bash
# Create temporary integration branch
git checkout main
git checkout -b integration-test
git merge pr5-room-ui
git merge pr6-export-png
# ... merge all pending PRs

# Run full test suite
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

### Step 4: Merge Order Strategy

**Priority Order:**
1. Core infrastructure first (features others depend on)
2. Independent features next (no dependencies)
3. UI enhancements last (depend on infrastructure)

**Merge Process:**
```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff pr{N}-branch-name -m "Merge PR #{N}: [Description]"
git push origin main

# Run smoke tests after each merge
pnpm test
pnpm build
```

### Step 5: Conflict Resolution

When conflicts occur:
1. Identify conflict type (file-level, dependency, import, type)
2. Apply resolution strategy
3. Re-test after resolution

### Step 6: Post-Merge Validation

After all PRs merged:
- Run full test suite
- Build production
- Manual smoke test
- Create merge report
```

---

## Phase 2: Agent Prompts

The magic happens when you give each agent its marching orders. Here's how to prompt each agent:

### Starting Agent A (First Task)

```
You are Agent A in a multi-agent development system. 
Read your instructions at `.cursor/agent-a-instructions.md`.

IMPORTANT: PR #1-4 are COMPLETE. You can start immediately.

Your current assignment: Complete PR #5 (Room Settings & Permissions UI)

Steps:
1. Switch to branch: git checkout pr5-room-ui
2. Read the requirements from the implementation plan in your instructions
3. Implement these components:
   - src/components/RoomSettings.tsx (settings modal)
   - src/components/RoomHeader.tsx (header with settings button)
   - Update src/components/CollabCanvas.tsx (add RoomHeader at TOP)
4. CRITICAL: In CollabCanvas.tsx, add RoomHeader at line ~50-60, BEFORE Tldraw component
5. Document exact line numbers in your submission
6. Run tests: pnpm test && pnpm build
7. Create submission file: .cursor/submissions/pr5-submission.md
8. Notify me when complete

Timeline: 3-4 hours

Begin implementation now.
```

### Starting Agent B (First Task - HIGH PRIORITY)

```
You are Agent B in a multi-agent development system.
Read your instructions at `.cursor/agent-b-instructions.md`.

IMPORTANT: PR #1-4 are COMPLETE. You can start immediately.
URGENT: Agent A needs your PR #6 completed to proceed with their PR #7.

Your current assignment: Complete PR #6 (Export to PNG/SVG)

Steps:
1. Switch to branch: git checkout pr6-export-png
2. Implement:
   - src/components/ExportDialog.tsx (export modal with PNG/SVG options)
   - src/lib/exportCanvas.ts (export functions with 50MB file size limit)
   - Update src/components/CollabCanvas.tsx (add export button in Tldraw toolbar override)
3. CRITICAL: Add export button inside Tldraw's components.Toolbar, NOT as separate element
4. Include file size validation (max 50MB, warn at 10MB)
5. Document exact line numbers in your submission
6. This PR is independent - no dependencies on other PRs
7. Run tests: pnpm test && pnpm build
8. Create submission file: .cursor/submissions/pr6-submission.md
9. Notify me when complete

Timeline: 2-3 hours

Begin implementation now.
```

**Key Workflow Changes from Original Article:**
- Agent A should complete PR #5 first, then WAIT for PR #6 to merge before starting PR #7
- Agent B should prioritize PR #6 (Agent A is blocked on it for PR #7)
- This sequencing prevents cross-agent dependencies and testing issues

### Activating Merge Coordinator

```
You are the Merge Coordinator.
Read your instructions at `.cursor/merge-coordinator-instructions.md`.

Available PR submissions:
- .cursor/submissions/pr5-submission.md (Agent A)
- .cursor/submissions/pr6-submission.md (Agent B)

Your tasks:
1. Review both submissions using the checklist
2. Check out each branch and verify tests/build
3. Check for conflicts between branches
4. Create integration-test branch and merge both
5. If conflicts, create feedback files for agents
6. If clear, merge in priority order
7. Create final merge report

Begin review process now.
```

## Phase 3: Communication Protocol

### The Submission Form

The submission form is the contract between development agents and the merge coordinator. Here's a complete example:

```markdown
# PR #5 Submission: Room Settings & Permissions UI

## Branch
pr5-room-ui

## Status
- [x] Implementation Complete
- [x] Tests Pass (pnpm test)
- [x] Build Succeeds (pnpm build)
- [x] No TypeScript Errors
- [x] Lint Clean (pnpm lint)

## Files Changed
- src/components/RoomSettings.tsx (new)
- src/components/RoomHeader.tsx (new)
- src/components/CollabCanvas.tsx (modified)
- src/lib/roomManagement.ts (modified - added validation)
- src/types/room.ts (modified - added RoomSettings type)

## Dependencies Added
None

## Breaking Changes
None

## Testing Instructions
1. Open app and navigate to a room
2. Click settings icon in room header (visible to owner only)
3. Test rename room → should update everywhere
4. Test toggle public/private → should update access
5. Test delete room → should redirect to room list
6. Verify non-owners don't see settings button

## Integration Notes
- **Dependencies**: Requires PR #2 (Room Metadata) to be merged first
- **Potential conflicts**: May conflict with PR #6 if it also modifies CollabCanvas.tsx
- **Merge order**: Should merge before PR #7 (keyboard shortcuts need settings modal)

## Screenshots
[Attached: settings-modal.png, room-header.png]

## Questions for Review
- Should delete confirmation be more prominent?
- Should we add "transfer ownership" option now or later?
```

### The Feedback Loop

When the Merge Coordinator finds issues, it creates a feedback file:

```markdown
# PR #5 Merge Feedback

## Status: Needs Changes

## Issues Found
1. Conflict with PR #6 in CollabCanvas.tsx line 234
   - Both PRs add different toolbar buttons
2. Test failure in RoomSettings.test.tsx
   - "should update room name" failing
3. TypeScript error in roomManagement.ts
   - Missing return type on validateRoomUpdate()

## Required Actions
- [ ] Resolve CollabCanvas.tsx conflict (see suggestions below)
- [ ] Fix failing test
- [ ] Add return type annotation

## Suggestions

### CollabCanvas.tsx conflict:
PR #5 adds settings button at line 234.
PR #6 adds export button at line 234.

**Recommended fix**: Place both buttons in toolbar array:
```tsx
<Toolbar>
  <SettingsButton /> {/* PR #5 */}
  <ExportButton />   {/* PR #6 */}
</Toolbar>
```

Please update your branch and resubmit.
```

### The Merge Report

After successful integration:

```markdown
# Integration Report - PRs #5-8

## Merge Summary
- PR #5 (Room UI): ✅ Merged (commit abc123)
- PR #6 (Export): ✅ Merged (commit def456)
- PR #7 (Keyboard): ✅ Merged (commit ghi789)
- PR #8 (Text Styling): ✅ Merged (commit jkl012)

## Conflicts Resolved
1. **CollabCanvas.tsx** (PR #5 vs PR #6)
   - Both added toolbar buttons
   - Resolution: Placed both in toolbar array
   - Affected lines: 234-240

2. **package.json** (PR #6 vs PR #8)
   - Both added dependencies
   - Resolution: Kept both, ran pnpm install
   - No breaking changes

## Changes Made During Integration
- Updated import order in CollabCanvas.tsx for consistency
- Added integration test for keyboard shortcuts + export dialog
- Fixed type error in TextStylePanel (missing null check)

## Final Test Results
- Unit Tests: ✅ 156/156 passing
- Build: ✅ Success (2.3s)
- Lint: ✅ 0 warnings
- Integration Tests: ✅ 12/12 passing

## Performance Metrics
- Bundle size increase: +47KB (acceptable)
- Load time impact: +120ms (acceptable)
- No new console warnings

## Known Issues
None

## Recommendations
1. Consider extracting toolbar into separate component (growing large)
2. Add E2E tests for multi-feature workflows
3. Document new keyboard shortcuts in user guide

## Next Steps
- Deploy to staging
- Update changelog
- Create demo video showing all new features
```

## Phase 4: Workflow Execution

### Day 1: Parallel Development (Revised Workflow)

**Morning (9:00 AM) - Both Agents Start**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Agent A
git checkout pr5-room-ui
# Open Cursor → Give Agent A PR #5 prompt
# Agent A begins implementing Room Settings UI

# Terminal 2: Agent B  
git checkout pr6-export-png
# Open new Cursor window → Give Agent B PR #6 prompt (HIGH PRIORITY)
# Agent B begins implementing Export feature
```

**Lunch Check-in (12:30 PM)**
- Agent A: ~50% complete on PR #5
- Agent B: ~60% complete on PR #6 (should finish first - it's simpler)
- Check for any blockers or questions

**Afternoon (2:00 PM)**
- Agent B completes PR #6 first → creates `.cursor/submissions/pr6-submission.md`
- Agent A completes PR #5 ~30 mins later → creates `.cursor/submissions/pr5-submission.md`
- You manually review both submission files for completeness

**Evening (5:00 PM) - Merge Coordinator Session 1**
```bash
# Terminal 3: Merge Coordinator
git checkout main
# Open Cursor → Give Coordinator prompt with both submissions

# Coordinator will:
# 1. Review PR #5 submission, checkout branch, test
# 2. Review PR #6 submission, checkout branch, test  
# 3. Merge PR #5 first (independent)
# 4. Merge PR #6 second (Agent A needs this)
# 5. Run integration test
```

**Result**: PR #5 and PR #6 merged to main by end of Day 1.

### Day 2: Second Round (Sequential, Not Parallel)

**Morning (9:00 AM) - Agent A Continues, Agent B Starts**
```bash
# Agent A starts PR #7 (Keyboard Shortcuts)
# NOTE: Can only start now because PR #6 is merged
git checkout pr7-keyboard-shortcuts
git merge main  # Get PR #5 and PR #6 changes

# Agent B starts PR #8 (Text Styling)  
git checkout pr8-text-styling
git merge main  # Get PR #5 and PR #6 changes
```

**Lunch Check-in (12:30 PM)**
- Agent A: ~50% complete on PR #7
- Agent B: ~50% complete on PR #8

**Afternoon (3:00 PM)**
- Agent A completes PR #7 → creates `.cursor/submissions/pr7-submission.md`
- Agent B completes PR #8 → creates `.cursor/submissions/pr8-submission.md`

**Evening (5:00 PM) - Merge Coordinator Session 2**
```bash
# Coordinator reviews and merges remaining PRs:
# 1. Merge PR #7 (depends on PR #5 and PR #6, already merged)
# 2. Merge PR #8 (independent, but last to minimize conflicts)
# 3. Run final integration test
# 4. Create integration report
```

**Result**: All 4 PRs completed and integrated in 2 days.

**Key Differences from Original Workflow:**
1. Agent B's PR #6 is **higher priority** (Agent A blocked without it)
2. Agent A must **wait for PR #6 merge** before starting PR #7
3. This creates a **slight sequential dependency** but prevents testing issues
4. Total time unchanged (~2 days), but with better quality

---

## Advanced Features

### Automated Conflict Detection

Create a script to check for conflicts before the merge coordinator gets involved:

**`scripts/check-conflicts.sh`**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "🔍 Checking for conflicts between branches..."

branches=("pr5-room-ui" "pr6-export-png" "pr7-keyboard-shortcuts" "pr8-text-styling")

for i in "${!branches[@]}"; do
  for j in "${!branches[@]}"; do
    if [ $i -lt $j ]; then
      branch1="${branches[$i]}"
      branch2="${branches[$j]}"
      
      echo "Comparing $branch1 with $branch2..."
      
      git checkout $branch1 2>/dev/null
      git merge-tree $(git merge-base $branch1 $branch2) $branch1 $branch2 > /tmp/merge-preview.txt
      
      if grep -q "<<<<<" /tmp/merge-preview.txt; then
        echo "❌ CONFLICT DETECTED between $branch1 and $branch2"
        echo "Files affected:"
        grep -B3 "<<<<<" /tmp/merge-preview.txt | grep "^+++ b/" | sed 's/^+++ b\//  - /'
      else
        echo "✅ No conflicts"
      fi
      echo ""
    fi
  done
done

git checkout main
```

Run this before activating the merge coordinator to get early warning.

### Pre-Merge Integration Test

**`.cursor/test-integration.sh`**
```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "🧪 Running integration test for all PRs..."

# Create temporary integration branch
git checkout main
git branch -D integration-test 2>/dev/null
git checkout -b integration-test

# Merge all PRs
for branch in pr5-room-ui pr6-export-png pr7-keyboard-shortcuts pr8-text-styling; do
  echo "Merging $branch..."
  git merge $branch --no-edit
  
  if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Merge conflict in $branch"
    git merge --abort
    exit 1
  fi
done

# Run tests
pnpm test && pnpm build

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "❌ Integration test failed"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Integration test passed!"

# Cleanup
git checkout main
git branch -D integration-test
```

This gives you a safety net before the coordinator touches main.

## Best Practices & Lessons Learned

### For the Orchestrator (You)

**DO:**
- ✅ Update status file regularly
- ✅ Review submission forms before giving to coordinator
- ✅ Assign one PR at a time per agent
- ✅ Keep agents in separate Cursor windows
- ✅ Test manually after coordinator merges

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Give agents ambiguous requirements
- ❌ Let agents work on overlapping files
- ❌ Skip the submission form process
- ❌ Rush the merge coordinator
- ❌ Mix contexts between agents

### For Development Agents

**DO:**
- ✅ Always verify current branch before starting
- ✅ Read full PR requirements
- ✅ Test locally before submitting
- ✅ Be specific in submission forms
- ✅ Ask questions in "Questions for Review"

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Assume dependencies are merged
- ❌ Skip tests to save time
- ❌ Leave TODOs in submitted code
- ❌ Modify files outside your PR scope
- ❌ Submit without running build

### For Merge Coordinator

**DO:**
- ✅ Merge in dependency order
- ✅ Test after each merge
- ✅ Document all conflict resolutions
- ✅ Create detailed feedback
- ✅ Final integration test with all features

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Merge without testing
- ❌ Ignore minor conflicts
- ❌ Skip the merge report
- ❌ Batch merge without testing between
- ❌ Modify code without informing agents

---

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback Plan

If integration fails catastrophically:

```bash
# 1. Save all work
git checkout pr5-room-ui && git branch pr5-backup
git checkout pr6-export-png && git branch pr6-backup
git checkout pr7-keyboard-shortcuts && git branch pr7-backup
git checkout pr8-text-styling && git branch pr8-backup

# 2. Reset main to last known good state
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

# 3. Retry integration one PR at a time
git merge pr5-backup
pnpm test && pnpm build  # Test thoroughly

git merge pr6-backup
pnpm test && pnpm build  # Test thoroughly

# Continue carefully...
```

### Agent Gets Stuck

If an agent can't complete its task:

1. **Pause the agent** → Don't let it spin
2. **Review its context** → Check instruction file
3. **Clarify requirements** → Update PR specification
4. **Restart with clearer prompt** → Be more specific
5. **Manual intervention if needed** → Sometimes you need to write code

### Merge Hell

If the coordinator encounters too many conflicts:

1. **Stop merging** → Don't force it
2. **Analyze conflicts** → What files are hot spots?
3. **Redesign boundaries** → Should PRs be split differently?
4. **Have agents rebase** → Update branches with latest main
5. **Merge smallest first** → Reduce conflict surface area

---

## Real-World Results

Using this system on the CollabCanvas project:

**Before Multi-Agent System:**
- 4 features = 8-10 days sequential
- High context switching overhead
- Frequent "what was I working on?" moments
- Merge conflicts discovered late

**After Multi-Agent System:**
- 4 features = 2 days parallel
- Clear ownership and boundaries
- Structured communication reduces confusion
- Conflicts caught early by automated checks

**Metrics:**
- **Development time**: 60% reduction
- **Merge conflicts**: 80% reduction (caught early)
- **Code quality**: Improved (coordinator enforces standards)
- **Context switching**: Near zero (agents stay focused)

---

## Limitations & Trade-offs

### When This System Works

✅ Multiple independent features  
✅ Clear requirements for each feature  
✅ AI agents capable of following structured instructions  
✅ Codebase with good test coverage  
✅ Features can be developed on separate branches
✅ Foundation/infrastructure work is complete before starting

### When This System Struggles

❌ Features with heavy interdependencies (like PR #7 depending on PR #6)
❌ Unclear or evolving requirements  
❌ Legacy codebase without tests  
❌ Agents lack domain knowledge  
❌ Rapid prototyping phase (too much process)
❌ Missing prerequisites (foundation not ready)

**Lessons Learned from CollabCanvas Implementation:**
- Even "independent" features can have subtle dependencies (keyboard shortcuts triggering dialogs)
- Agents need EXTREMELY detailed placement guidance when modifying shared files (CollabCanvas.tsx)
- Timeline estimates help agents prioritize correctly
- Mobile testing requirements must be explicit (viewport sizes, touch targets)
- File size limits and validation should be specified upfront (export: 50MB limit)
- Multi-user testing setup instructions are critical for permission features  

### Trade-offs

**Gains:**
- Parallel development speed
- Reduced context switching
- Structured quality control
- Clear communication protocol

**Costs:**
- Upfront setup time (30-60 min)
- Overhead of submission forms
- Need for merge coordinator
- More complex git history

---

## Conclusion

The multi-agent development system transforms how AI assistants collaborate on codebases. By introducing clear roles, structured communication, and a dedicated merge coordinator, you can:

1. **Scale development** with parallel work streams
2. **Maintain quality** through automated checks and reviews
3. **Reduce conflicts** with early detection and isolation
4. **Accelerate delivery** without sacrificing code quality

The key insight: **building code and integrating code are different skills**. Separating these concerns with specialized agents creates a more efficient and maintainable workflow.

### Next Steps

1. **Start small**: Try with 2 PRs and 1 agent first
2. **Refine prompts**: Adjust instruction files based on your codebase
3. **Automate checks**: Add conflict detection and integration tests
4. **Scale up**: Add more agents as you gain confidence
5. **Measure results**: Track time saved and conflicts avoided

The future of software development isn't replacing developers with AI—it's orchestrating multiple AI agents like a conductor leading an orchestra. This system gives you the baton.

**About This System**: Originally developed for CollabCanvas, a real-time collaborative whiteboard application. Used to coordinate 4 feature developments (Room UI, Export, Keyboard Shortcuts, Text Styling) completed in 2 days.

**Key Success Factors:**
1. **Prerequisites complete**: PRs #1-4 (multi-room foundation) were finished before starting agent work
2. **Detailed conflict prevention**: Agents told exactly where to add code in shared files
3. **Clear dependency mapping**: PR #7 dependencies on PR #5 and PR #6 explicitly documented
4. **Backup branches created**: Enabled safe rollback if integration failed
5. **Timeline estimates**: Helped prioritize PR #6 (2-3 hrs) over PR #5 (3-4 hrs)
6. **Mobile testing specs**: Prevented responsive design issues (viewport sizes, touch targets)
7. **File size limits**: Export feature had 50MB limit specified upfront
8. **Multi-user testing setup**: Permission testing instructions included

**Actual Results:**
- **Merge conflicts**: Only CollabCanvas.tsx (as predicted), resolved in minutes
- **Rollbacks**: Zero (backup branches unused)
- **Code quality**: High (detailed instructions + merge coordinator review)
- **Development speed**: 2 days for 4 features (8-10 days if sequential)

**GitHub Template**: Full implementation with instruction files available in this repository at `.cursor/agent-a-instructions.md`, `.cursor/agent-b-instructions.md`, and `.cursor/merge-coordinator-instructions.md`.
