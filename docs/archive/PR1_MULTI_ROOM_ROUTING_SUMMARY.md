# PR #1: Multi-Room Routing Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Working  
**Impact:** CRITICAL - Resolved aspirational vs reality gap

---

## 🎯 Mission

Implement the missing PR #1 (Multi-Room Routing) that was marked "complete" in planning documents but never actually built. This was the foundational prerequisite for the multi-agent workflow.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### New Pages (3)
1. **`src/app/page.tsx`** - Updated to redirect to `/rooms`
2. **`src/app/rooms/page.tsx`** - Room list and creation page (332 lines)
3. **`src/app/room/[roomId]/page.tsx`** - Individual room page (134 lines)

### New Utilities (2)
1. **`src/lib/paths.ts`** - Path utilities and room ID validation (72 lines)
   - `isValidRoomId()` - Validates room ID format
   - `generateRoomId()` - Creates unique room IDs
   - `getRoomPath()`, `getRoomsPath()`, `getHomePath()`
   - `extractRoomIdFromPath()` - Parses room ID from URL
   - `normalizeRoomName()` - Sanitizes user input

2. **`src/hooks/useRoomId.ts`** - Extract room ID from URL (38 lines)
   - Type-safe extraction from Next.js params
   - Validation and edge case handling

### Tests (2 files, 21 tests)
1. **`src/lib/__tests__/paths.test.ts`** - 15 passing tests
2. **`src/hooks/__tests__/useRoomId.test.ts`** - 6 passing tests

### Updated Files (2)
1. **`src/app/page.tsx`** - Changed from direct canvas to redirect
2. **`src/components/CollabCanvas.tsx`** - Uses roomId from props instead of hardcoded "default"

### Firebase Configuration (3 files)
1. **`firestore.rules`** - Added collection group rules for metadata queries
2. **`firestore.indexes.json`** - Added composite indexes
3. **`database.rules.json`** - (No changes needed)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### URL Structure
```
Before PR #1:
/ → CollabCanvas (always "default" room)

After PR #1:
/ → Redirect to /rooms
/rooms → Room list page
/room/[roomId] → Specific room canvas
```

### Room ID Format
- **Pattern**: `{timestamp}-{random}`
- **Example**: `mgt3oppl-qvumldmw`
- **Validation**: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$/`
- **Uniqueness**: 2.8 trillion combinations per second

### Firestore Collection Group Queries
```typescript
// Query all room metadata across all rooms
collectionGroup(db, "metadata")
  .where("owner", "==", userId)
  .limit(50)

// Structure: rooms/{roomId}/metadata/info
// Collection group name: "metadata" (not "info")
```

### Security Rules
```javascript
// Allow collection group queries on metadata
match /{path=**}/metadata/{doc} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow create: if request.auth != null && 
                   request.resource.data.owner == request.auth.uid;
  allow update, delete: if request.auth != null && 
                           resource.data.owner == request.auth.uid;
}
```

## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Resolved

### Issue 1: Permission Denied on Collection Group Queries
**Error**: `FirebaseError: Missing or insufficient permissions`

**Cause**: Firestore rules only covered specific paths (`/rooms/{roomId}/metadata/info`), not collection group queries

**Solution**: Added collection group rule `match /{path=**}/metadata/{doc}`

**Fixed in**: Commit `8695f5c`

### Issue 2: Wrong Collection Group Name
**Error**: Query returning 0 results

**Cause**: Used `collectionGroup(db, "info")` instead of `collectionGroup(db, "metadata")`

**Explanation**: 
- Path: `rooms/{roomId}/metadata/info`
- "metadata" is the **collection name**
- "info" is the **document ID**
- Collection group queries use the collection name

**Solution**: Changed to `collectionGroup(db, "metadata")`

**Fixed in**: Commit `8695f5c`

### Issue 3: Missing Composite Indexes
**Error**: `The query requires a COLLECTION_GROUP_ASC index for collection metadata and field owner`

**Cause**: Collection group queries with where clauses require composite indexes

**Solution**: 
1. Added indexes to `firestore.indexes.json`
2. Deployed with `firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes`
3. Waited ~3 minutes for indexes to build

**Fixed in**: Commit `8695f5c`

## ✅ Integration Status

### Perfect Integration with Existing PRs

**PR #2 (Room Metadata)**: ✅
- Room list queries use `getRoomMetadata()`
- Room creation uses `createRoom()`
- Metadata displays correctly in UI

## 📝 Lessons Learned

### Discovery
1. **Planning vs Reality Gap**: PR #1 was marked "complete" but was aspirational
2. **Importance of Verification**: Always verify dependencies actually exist
3. **Collection Group Complexity**: Requires proper rules, indexes, and naming

### Technical Insights
1. **Collection Group Naming**: Use the actual collection name, not folder names
2. **Firestore Rules**: Collection group queries need wildcard path rules
3. **Index Build Time**: Composite indexes take 2-5 minutes to build
4. **Debug Logging**: Critical for troubleshooting Firestore queries

### Process Improvements
1. **Thorough Reviews**: Check that "complete" items are actually implemented
2. **Test Infrastructure**: Build tests alongside features
3. **Incremental Deployment**: Deploy rules, test, then deploy indexes
4. **Clear Documentation**: Update docs as implementation progresses

---

## 🎓 Key Takeaways

### For Future PRs
1. ✅ Verify prerequisites actually exist before starting dependent work
2. ✅ Test Firestore queries locally before deploying
3. ✅ Add comprehensive debug logging during development
4. ✅ Document exact Firestore paths in comments
5. ✅ Deploy security rules before implementing features that use them

### For Multi-Agent Workflow
1. ✅ PR #1 was the real blocker, not PRs #5-8
2. ✅ Foundation must be 100% real before agent work starts
3. ✅ "Complete" in docs doesn't mean "implemented"
4. ✅ Manual verification of prerequisites is essential
