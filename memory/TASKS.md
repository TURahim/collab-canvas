- `database.rules.json` (validation rules for room presence)
- `src/lib/roomManagement.ts` (improved delete with assets cleanup)

**Bug Fixes Included:**
1. ✅ Ban listener permission errors - Added read permission for bans/$uid
2. ✅ Cursor update validation errors - Changed from require-all-fields to per-field validation
3. ✅ Firebase Storage CORS errors - Configured CORS via gsutil
4. ✅ Delete room permission errors - Added write permission at room level
5. ✅ Assets not cleaned up on delete - Added assets collection cleanup
