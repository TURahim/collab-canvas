# Version History - Owner-Only Permissions

**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Change:** Restricted save/restore operations to room owners only

---

## Permission Model

### Before (Incorrect Assumption)
- ❌ Assumed all room members could save/restore versions
- ❌ UI checked for `isRoomMember()`
- ❌ Error messages said "member"

### After (Correct Implementation)
- ✅ **Only room owners** can save versions
- ✅ **Only room owners** can restore versions
- ✅ UI uses `isOwner` prop (already passed from CollabCanvas)
- ✅ Error messages say "owner"
- ✅ Clear visual indicators for non-owners

---

## Permission Matrix

| Action | Room Owner | Room Members | Non-Members |
|--------|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **View Versions** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (read-only) | ❌ No (403) |
| **Save Version** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (disabled) | ❌ No (403) |
| **Restore Version** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (disabled) | ❌ No (403) |
| **Delete Own Version** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (if creator) | ❌ No (403) |
| **Delete Others' Version** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (403) | ❌ No (403) |

## UI Changes

### Warning Banner (Non-Owners)

⚠️ You are not a room member. Ask the owner to add you...
```

**After:**

```

### Save Button

**Before:**
```
[Save Version (Members Only)]
```

```

**Tooltip:**
- Non-owner: "Only the room owner can save versions"
- Owner: "Save a snapshot of the current canvas"

### Restore Button

**Before:**
```
Tooltip: "Only room members can restore versions"
```

**After:**
```
Tooltip: "Only the room owner can restore versions"
```

### Footer Message

**Before:**
```
⚠️ You need to be a room member to save or restore versions.
```

**After:**
```
⚠️ Only the room owner can save or restore versions.
```

## Error Messages

### Save Errors

**Permission Pre-Check:**
```typescript
if (!isOwner) {
  setToast({
    message: "Only the room owner can save versions.",
    type: "error"
  });
  return;
}
```

**Firebase Permission Error:**
```typescript
if (error.message?.includes("permission")) {
  setToast({
    message: "Permission denied. Only the room owner can save versions.",
    type: "error"
  });
}
```

### Restore Errors

**Permission Pre-Check:**
```typescript
if (!isOwner) {
  setToast({
    message: "Only the room owner can restore versions.",
    type: "error"
  });
  return;
}
```

**Firebase Permission Error:**
```typescript
if (error.message?.includes("permission")) {
  setToast({
    message: "Permission denied. Only the room owner can restore versions.",
    type: "error"
  });
}
```

### Delete Errors

```typescript
if (error.message?.includes("permission")) {
  setToast({
    message: "Permission denied. Only the creator or room owner can delete versions.",
    type: "error"
  });
}
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### Permission Check

**Uses existing `isOwner` prop:**
```typescript
export interface VersionHistoryModalProps {
  roomId: string;
  editor: Editor | null;
  userId: string;
  isOwner: boolean;  // ← Passed from CollabCanvas
  onClose: () => void;
}
```

**In CollabCanvas:**
```typescript
<VersionHistoryModal
  roomId={roomId}
  editor={editor}
  userId={user.uid}
  isOwner={roomMetadata.owner === user.uid}  // ← Owner check
  onClose={() => setShowVersionModal(false)}
/>
```

### Removed Unnecessary Code

**Removed:**
- ❌ `isRoomMember()` import (not needed)
- ❌ `isMember` state variable
- ❌ `checkMembership()` function
- ❌ `useEffect` for membership check

**Result:**
- ✅ Simpler code
- ✅ Fewer API calls
- ✅ Uses existing prop

---

## User Experience

### For Room Owner

**View:**
- ✅ No warning banner
- ✅ All buttons enabled
- ✅ "Save Version" button active (blue)
- ✅ "Restore" buttons active (green)
- ✅ Can save/restore freely

**Actions:**
1. Click "Save Version"
2. Enter label
3. Click "Save"
4. ✨ Green toast: "✓ Snapshot 'My Label' saved successfully!"

### For Non-Owner Room Members

**View:**
- ⚠️ Yellow warning banner: "You are not the room owner..."
- 🔒 "Save Version (Owner Only)" button disabled
- 🔒 "Restore" buttons disabled with opacity
- 📖 Can view version list (read-only)
- 📖 Footer shows: "Only the room owner can save or restore"

**Actions:**
1. Hover "Save Version" → Tooltip: "Only the room owner can save versions"
2. If clicked → Red error toast
3. Can still view version history
4. Can delete their own versions (if they created any)

### For Non-Members

**View:**
- ❌ Can't access the modal at all (Firebase rules block)
- ❌ Red error toast: "Only room owners can access versions"

## Code Quality

- ✅ Proper type guards before operations
- ✅ `const currentEditor = editor` pattern for null-safe usage

### Error Messages

### UI/UX
- ✅ Visual feedback before user tries (warning banner)
- ✅ Disabled states prevent errors
- ✅ Tooltips explain why disabled
