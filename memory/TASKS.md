### ‚úì Room-Scoped Presence System
**Completed:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented, tested, and deployed

**Solution Implemented:**

- `src/components/CollabCanvas.tsx` (1 line added, roomId prop)
- `database.rules.json` (validation rules for room presence)
- `src/lib/roomManagement.ts` (improved delete with assets cleanup)

**Bug Fixes Included:**
1. ‚úÖ Ban listener permission errors - Added read permission for bans/$uid
2. ‚úÖ Cursor update validation errors - Changed from require-all-fields to per-field validation
3. ‚úÖ Firebase Storage CORS errors - Configured CORS via gsutil
4. ‚úÖ Delete room permission errors - Added write permission at room level
5. ‚úÖ Assets not cleaned up on delete - Added assets collection cleanup

**Total Changes:**
