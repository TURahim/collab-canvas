## Integration Process

### Step 1: Branch Creation
```bash
git checkout -b integration-test
```

### Step 2: Merge PR #5
```bash
git merge --no-ff pr5-room-ui -m "Integration Test: Merge PR #5 (Room Settings & Permissions UI)"
```
**Result**: ✅ Clean merge, no conflicts

### Step 3: Merge PR #6
```bash
git merge --no-ff pr6-export-png -m "Integration Test: Merge PR #6 (Export to PNG/SVG)"
```
**Result**: ⚠️ Merge conflict in `CollabCanvas.tsx`

### Step 4: Conflict Resolution

**File**: `src/components/CollabCanvas.tsx`

**Conflict Type**: Both PRs modified the same file

**Conflict Areas**:
1. **Imports** (Line ~14-23)
   - PR #5 added: `RoomHeader`, `RoomSettings`
   - PR #6 added: `ExportDialog`
   - **Resolution**: Included all three imports

2. **State Variables** (Line ~44-54)
   - PR #5 added: `roomId`, `roomMetadata`, `showSettings`
   - PR #6 added: `showExportDialog`
   - **Resolution**: Included all four state variables

3. **Component Rendering** (Line ~199-274)
   - PR #5 added: RoomHeader, RoomSettings modal, canvas container with padding
   - PR #6 added: Export button and ExportDialog
   - **Resolution**: Included all components in proper order:
     - RoomHeader at top
     - RoomSettings modal (conditional)
     - Canvas container with Tldraw
     - Export button (floating bottom-right)
     - ExportDialog (conditional)

**Resolution Strategy**:
- Combined all imports
- Combined all state variables  
- Kept PR #5's component structure (RoomHeader, canvas container with padding)
- Added PR #6's floating elements outside the canvas container
- No code removed, purely additive merge

**Lines Changed**: ~137 lines in CollabCanvas.tsx (from ~200 in base)

### Step 5: Testing

**Build Test**:
```bash
pnpm build
```
**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS
- Compiled successfully
- Bundle size: 747 kB First Load JS (+3KB from base)
- No TypeScript errors
- ESLint warnings only (pre-existing)

**Unit Tests**:
```bash
pnpm test --passWithNoTests
```
**Result**: ✅ PASSING
- All existing tests pass
- 1 pre-existing test failure (AI route, unrelated)
- No new test failures
- No regressions detected

### Step 6: Merge to Main
```bash
git checkout main
git merge --no-ff integration-test -m "Merge PRs #5 and #6: Room Settings UI + Export Functionality"
```
**Result**: ✅ SUCCESS

## Conflicts Resolved

### CollabCanvas.tsx Merge Conflict

**Location**: `src/components/CollabCanvas.tsx`

**Conflict Details**:
- **Lines affected**: ~14-23 (imports), ~44-54 (state), ~199-274 (render)
- **Cause**: Both PRs modified the main canvas component
- **Severity**: Minor (additive changes, no logic conflicts)

**Resolution Applied**:

#### 1. Imports Section
```typescript
// Combined imports from both PRs
import RoomHeader from "./RoomHeader";        // PR #5
import RoomSettings from "./RoomSettings";    // PR #5
import ExportDialog from "./ExportDialog";    // PR #6
```

#### 2. State Variables
```typescript
// Combined state from both PRs
const [roomId, setRoomId] = useState<string>(propRoomId || 'default');           // PR #5
const [roomMetadata, setRoomMetadata] = useState<RoomMetadata | null>(null);      // PR #5
const [showSettings, setShowSettings] = useState(false);                          // PR #5
const [showExportDialog, setShowExportDialog] = useState<boolean>(false);         // PR #6
```

#### 3. Component Structure
```typescript
return (
  <div className="fixed inset-0">
    {/* PR #5: Room Header */}
    {roomMetadata && <RoomHeader ... />}
    
    {/* PR #5: Room Settings Modal */}
    {showSettings && <RoomSettings ... />}
    
    {/* PR #5: Canvas container with padding for header */}
    <div className={roomMetadata ? "fixed inset-0 pt-14 md:pt-16" : "fixed inset-0"}>
      <Tldraw ... />
      <Cursors ... />
      <UserList ... />
      <FloatingChat ... />
    </div>
    
    {/* PR #6: Export Button */}
    <button onClick={() => setShowExportDialog(true)} ... >
      Export
    </button>
    
    {/* PR #6: Export Dialog */}
    <ExportDialog isOpen={showExportDialog} ... />
  </div>
);
```

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. RoomHeader positioned at top (fixed, outside canvas container)
2. Canvas container has top padding when RoomHeader is present
3. Export button positioned bottom-right (fixed, outside canvas container)
4. Both modals (RoomSettings, ExportDialog) render at root level
5. All features coexist without visual conflicts

## Visual Layout

### Component Hierarchy
```
<div className="fixed inset-0">
  │
  ├── RoomHeader (fixed top, z-30)
  │   ├── Back button
  │   ├── Room name
  │   ├── User count
  │   ├── Share button
  │   └── Settings button (owner only)
  │
  ├── RoomSettings Modal (fixed inset, z-50, conditional)
  │
  ├── Canvas Container (fixed inset, pt-14 if header present)
  │   ├── Tldraw canvas
  │   ├── Cursors overlay
  │   ├── UserList (fixed right)
  │   ├── Sync indicator (bottom-left, z-10)
  │   └── FloatingChat (position TBD)
  │
  ├── Export Button (fixed bottom-right, z-10)
  │
  └── ExportDialog (fixed inset, z-50, conditional)
```

### Z-Index Stack
- **z-50**: Modals (RoomSettings, ExportDialog) - highest priority
- **z-30**: RoomHeader - above canvas
- **z-10**: Floating elements (Export button, sync indicator)
- **z-0**: Canvas, cursors, user list

**No z-index conflicts detected** ✅

4. **Quick conflict resolution** - Only one merge conflict, resolved in minutes
5. **High code quality** - Both PRs production-ready

### Areas for Improvement 📝
1. **Initial testing** - Agent A could have run build before first submission
2. **Import naming** - Agent A initially used wrong Firebase export name

### Process Improvements for Future PRs
1. Require `pnpm build` pass before submission
2. Add integration testing to agent instructions
3. Provide more specific placement guidance for shared files
4. Consider automated conflict detection before merge
