# AI Move Commands Fix - Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**Branch:** main

---

## Problem Summary

AI "move to center" commands were reporting success but not actually moving shapes. This was due to a complete interface mismatch between the OpenAI function schema, the dispatch logic, and the canvas tools implementation.

### Root Cause

1. **OpenAI Schema** (route.ts:98-122): Defined `moveShape` with keywords like `{target, x: "center", y: "center"}`
2. **Dispatch Logic** (FloatingChat.tsx:215-227): Expected `{deltaX, deltaY}` and extracted undefined values
3. **Canvas Tools** (canvasTools.ts:349-372): Only supported relative delta movement
4. **Result**: Shape moved by (0, 0) - success reported, no visual change

**Key Issue**: The type definition existed in `src/types/ai.ts:155-159` but was never implemented.

---

## Solution Implemented

### Phase 1: Position Resolution Utilities (canvasTools.ts)

Added three helper functions after `getViewportCenter()` (lines 129-254):

1. **`resolvePositionKeyword()`** - Converts keywords to absolute page coordinates
   - Supports: 'center', 'left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom'
   - Captures viewport once to avoid pan/zoom race conditions
   - Falls back to numeric coordinates

2. **`getUnionBounds()`** - Calculates bounding box of multiple shapes
   - Returns center point of union bounds
   - Handles geo shapes, text shapes, and mixed selections
   - Preserves relative layout when moving groups

3. **`validateMovableShapes()`** - Validates shapes can be moved
   - Checks: exists, on current page, not locked
   - Returns valid and invalid arrays with reasons
   - Prevents silent no-ops

**Total Added**: ~126 lines

---

### Phase 2: New moveShapeTo Function (canvasTools.ts)

Added main `moveShapeTo()` function (lines 501-621):

**Key Features:**
- **Union Bounds Approach**: Moves the center of all selected shapes together, preserving layout
- **Keyword Support**: 'center', 'left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom'
- **Numeric Coordinates**: Direct x/y values
- **Target Resolution**: 'selected', 'all', single ID, or array of IDs
- **Validation**: Skips locked/deleted/wrong-page shapes with descriptive errors
- **Multiple Updates**: Calls `editor.updateShape()` for each shape (tldraw v4 automatically groups rapid updates)
- **Movement Detection**: Returns `actuallyMoved: false` if delta < 0.5px (prevents false success)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Supports legacy `deltaX/deltaY` parameters

Added helper `moveShapesByDelta()` function (lines 623-674):
- Handles backward-compatible relative movement
- Reuses validation logic
- Uses same loop pattern as main function

**Total Added**: ~174 lines

---

### Phase 3: FloatingChat Dispatch Update

Updated `src/components/FloatingChat.tsx`:

1. **Import** (line 17): Added `moveShapeTo` to imports
2. **Dispatch Logic** (lines 205-236): Complete rewrite of moveShape case
   - Calls new `moveShapeTo()` function
   - Passes target, x, y, deltaX, deltaY from AI arguments
   - Builds descriptive success messages
   - Reports when shape already at target
   - Shows count of skipped shapes with reasons
   - Wraps in try/catch with error messages

**Total Modified**: ~32 lines

---

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Tests

Created `src/lib/__tests__/moveShapeTo.test.ts` with 18 test cases:

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Keyword resolution (center, left, right, top, bottom)
- ✅ Numeric coordinates (absolute x/y)
- ✅ Partial coordinates (x only, y only)
- ✅ Target resolution (selected, all)
- ✅ Shape validation (locked shapes skipped, wrong page error)
- ✅ Union bounds (layout preservation for multiple shapes)
- ✅ Edge cases (already at target, no parameters provided)
- ✅ Backward compatibility (deltaX/deltaY support)
- ✅ Multiple shape updates (sequential updateShape calls)

**Note**: Tests are written correctly but cannot run due to pre-existing jest/ESM configuration issue with tldraw modules (8 test suites already failing in project).

**Total Added**: ~600 lines

## Implementation Details

### Union Bounds Approach (User Suggestion ✅)

Instead of moving each shape to the same point (which would stack them), we:
1. Calculate union bounds of all selected shapes
2. Find the center point of the union bounds
3. Calculate delta to move union center to target
4. Apply same delta to all shapes
5. **Result**: Relative layout preserved

**Example:**
```
Before: Two shapes 100px apart
After move to center: Still 100px apart, but group centered
```

### Movement Detection (User Suggestion ✅)

Prevents false success reports:
- Checks if delta is significant (>= 0.5px)
- Returns `actuallyMoved: false` if no real movement
- UI shows "already at target position" message

### Validation & Error Handling (User Suggestion ✅)

Explicit checks for:
- ❌ Locked shapes → skipped with reason
- ❌ Shapes on different page → skipped with reason
- ❌ Deleted/non-existent shapes → skipped with reason
- ❌ Empty selection → descriptive error thrown
- ✅ Only valid shapes moved

### Multiple Shape Updates (User Suggestion ✅)

All shape updates use sequential `editor.updateShape()` calls:
- tldraw v4 doesn't have a `batch()` method
- Sequential updates are the standard pattern in the codebase
- Editor automatically handles rapid updates efficiently

### Edge Cases Handled (User Suggestions ✅)

- Groups: Uses shape bounds from props (w, h)
- Rotated shapes: Transform applied to top-left, rotation preserved
- Text shapes: Handles different bounds calculation
- Mixed selections: Geo + text shapes together
- Zoom/pan race: Viewport captured once at start
- Rounding: 0.5px threshold prevents micro-movements

## Verification

### Manual Testing Checklist

1. ✅ "move to center" - Shape moves to viewport center
2. ✅ "move to left" - Shape moves 100px from left edge
3. ✅ "move to right" - Shape moves 100px from right edge
4. ✅ "move to top" - Shape moves 100px from top edge
5. ✅ "move to bottom" - Shape moves 100px from bottom edge
6. ✅ Multiple selected shapes - Layout preserved
7. ✅ No selection - Shows error "No shapes selected"
8. ✅ Locked shape - Shows "skipped: locked" message
9. ✅ Already at target - Shows "already at target position"
10. ✅ Backward compat - deltaX/deltaY still works

### Linter Status

✅ No linter errors in any modified files
- `src/lib/canvasTools.ts` - Clean
- `src/components/FloatingChat.tsx` - Clean
- `src/lib/__tests__/moveShapeTo.test.ts` - Clean

### Test Status

⚠️ Tests written but cannot run due to pre-existing jest configuration issue with tldraw ESM modules. This affects 8 test suites project-wide, not introduced by this change.

**Pre-existing test failures**: 8 suites, 25 tests  
**New test file**: Would add 18 tests when jest config is fixed

---

## Breaking Changes

None. The implementation is fully backward compatible:
- Existing `moveShape(deltaX, deltaY)` function preserved
- New `moveShapeTo()` supports both new (x/y keywords) and legacy (deltaX/deltaY) interfaces
- No changes to existing command signatures

---

## Performance Impact

- **Neutral**: Sequential `editor.updateShape()` calls (standard tldraw v4 pattern)
- **Negligible**: Union bounds calculation O(n) where n = number of selected shapes
- **No network impact**: All operations client-side

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Jest Configuration**: Fix ESM module handling for tldraw (project-wide issue)
2. **Animation**: Add smooth transition for "move to" commands
3. **Snap to Grid**: Add optional grid snapping
4. **Relative Keywords**: Support "move left 100px" style commands
5. **transformShape**: Apply similar fix if it has the same issue

---

## Example Usage

### Before (Broken):
```typescript
// User says: "move to center"
// GPT returns: { target: "selected", x: "center", y: "center" }
// Dispatch extracts: deltaX = undefined || 0 = 0
// Result: moveShape by (0, 0) ❌ No visible change
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// User says: "move to center"
// GPT returns: { target: "selected", x: "center", y: "center" }
// Dispatch calls: moveShapeTo({ target: "selected", x: "center", y: "center" })
// Result: Shape moves to viewport center ✅
```

## Acknowledgments

Implementation followed user-provided guidance on:
- Union bounds approach for layout preservation
- Movement detection to prevent false positives
- Validation logic for locked/readonly shapes
- Sequential updates following tldraw v4 patterns
- Edge case handling (groups, rotation, mixed selections)

**Implementation Complete**: All phases delivered as planned ✅
