# PR Submissions

This directory contains PR submission forms created by Agent A and Agent B.

## Submission Files

When an agent completes their PR, they create a submission file here:

- `pr5-submission.md` - Room Settings & Permissions UI (Agent A)
- `pr6-submission.md` - Export to PNG/SVG (Agent B)
- `pr7-submission.md` - Keyboard Shortcuts (Agent A)
- `pr8-submission.md` - Text Styling Panel (Agent B)

## After Integration

Once the Merge Coordinator successfully integrates all PRs, an integration report is created:

- `integration-report.md` - Summary of all merges, conflicts resolved, and final test results

## Format

Each submission file follows the template in the agent instruction files and includes:
- Status checklist
- Files changed
- Dependencies added
- Testing instructions
- Integration notes
- Screenshots/demo (for UI changes)
