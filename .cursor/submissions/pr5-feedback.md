## Required Actions

To complete PR #5, you must:

### Step 1: Verify You're on the Correct Branch
```bash
git checkout pr5-room-ui
git status
```

### Step 2: Implement the Required Features

#### A. Create RoomSettings Component (`src/components/RoomSettings.tsx`)
- Modal dialog with room configuration options
- Rename room functionality
- Toggle public/private access
- Delete room with confirmation
- Owner-only access (check `room.ownerId === user.uid`)
- Use shadcn/ui or similar for modal UI

#### B. Create RoomHeader Component (`src/components/RoomHeader.tsx`)
- Display room name
- Settings button (gear icon, owner only)
- Opens RoomSettings modal on click
- Clean, minimal design that doesn't interfere with canvas

#### C. Modify CollabCanvas Component (`src/components/CollabCanvas.tsx`)
- Add RoomHeader at the TOP of the component (around line 50-60)
- Pass roomId prop to RoomHeader
- Ensure it doesn't block the canvas
- Example:
```tsx
return (
  <div className="relative w-full h-full">
    <RoomHeader roomId={roomId} />
    <Tldraw ... />
    {/* other components */}
  </div>
);
```

#### D. Update RoomManagement Library (`src/lib/roomManagement.ts`)
- Add `updateRoomSettings()` function
- Add `deleteRoom()` function with cascade delete
- Add validation for room name (min/max length)
- Add permission checks

#### E. Update Types (`src/types/room.ts`)
- Add `RoomSettings` interface if needed
- Add any new types for room operations

### Step 3: Test Your Implementation
Run all tests before submitting:
```bash
pnpm test
pnpm build
pnpm lint
```

Test manually:
1. Open a room you own
2. Verify settings button appears in header
3. Click settings button → modal should open
4. Test rename functionality
5. Test public/private toggle
6. Test delete with confirmation
7. Open a room you DON'T own
8. Verify settings button does NOT appear

### Step 4: Commit and Push Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add room settings and permissions UI (PR #5)"
git push origin pr5-room-ui
```

### Step 5: Create Submission Form

Create `.cursor/submissions/pr5-submission.md` with this content:

```markdown
# PR #5 Submission: Room Settings & Permissions UI

## Branch
pr5-room-ui

## Status
- [x] Implementation Complete
- [x] Tests Pass (pnpm test)

## Files Changed

## Dependencies Added
None (or list any new packages)

## Breaking Changes
None

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the app: `pnpm dev`
2. Navigate to a room you own at `/room/[roomId]`
3. Verify settings button (gear icon) appears in room header
4. Click settings button → modal should open
5. Test rename: Change room name → verify it updates everywhere
6. Test access: Toggle public/private → verify it updates
7. Test delete: Click delete → confirm → should redirect to /rooms
8. Navigate to a room you DON'T own
9. Verify settings button does NOT appear

## Integration Notes
- **Dependencies**: Requires PR #2 (Room Metadata) - already merged ✅
- **Potential conflicts**: May conflict with PR #6 if it also modifies CollabCanvas.tsx
  - My changes are at the TOP (RoomHeader)
  - PR #6 likely modifies toolbar area
  - Should be minimal conflict
- **Merge order**: Can merge anytime, but PR #7 depends on this

## Screenshots
[Describe or attach screenshots of:]
- Room header with settings button
- Settings modal open
- Delete confirmation dialog

## Questions for Review
- Does the UI styling match the rest of the app?
- Should delete require typing room name for confirmation?
```
