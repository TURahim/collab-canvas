## üìù NOTES & CONVENTIONS

### Git Workflow
- Work in feature branches
- PR titles: "AI: [Feature Name]"
- Commit messages: Descriptive and concise
- Merge strategy: Squash and merge to `dev`
- Final merge: `dev` ‚Üí `main` after all PRs complete

### Code Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint and Prettier configured
- Function naming: camelCase
- Component naming: PascalCase
- File naming: camelCase for utilities, PascalCase for components
- Exports: Named exports preferred
- Error handling: Always throw descriptive Error objects

### Testing Conventions
- Test file naming: `[filename].test.ts(x)`
- Test descriptions: Clear and specific
- Mock naming: `mock[FunctionName]`
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- One assertion per test (when possible)

### Documentation
- JSDoc comments for all public functions
- README.md kept up-to-date
- Inline comments for complex logic
- Type annotations for all function parameters

## üìû SUPPORT & RESOURCES

### Documentation
- PRD_Final.md (this implementation plan)
- README.md (project overview and setup)
- architecture.md (system design)
- TESTING.md (test strategy)
- AI_COMMANDS.md (command reference - to be created)

### External Resources
- [OpenAI Function Calling Docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling)
- [OpenAI Node.js SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-node)
- [tldraw Editor API](https://tldraw.dev/reference/editor/Editor)
- [tldraw Shape Creation Examples](https://tldraw.dev/examples/shapes/creating-shapes)

### Key Decisions & Rationale
1. **GPT-4 over GPT-3.5:** Better function calling accuracy, worth the cost
2. **Client-side API calls:** Simpler for MVP, can proxy later
3. **Session-only history:** Simplest implementation, sufficient for demo
4. **10 commands/hour rate limit:** Balances cost and usability
5. **8 commands instead of 6:** Provides better variety and showcase
