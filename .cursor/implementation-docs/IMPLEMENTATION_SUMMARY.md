## Deployment Instructions

### 1. Deploy Firebase Rules

```bash
# Deploy all rules (Firestore, Realtime DB, Storage)
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,database,storage

# Or deploy individually:
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
firebase deploy --only database
firebase deploy --only storage
```

### 2. Verify Environment Variables

Ensure `.env.local` has Storage bucket configured:
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-app.appspot.com
```

### 3. Test Locally

```bash
# Start dev server
pnpm dev

# (Optional) Start Firebase emulators
firebase emulators:start
```

### 4. Deploy to Production

```bash
# Build and deploy
pnpm build
vercel --prod
```

**Total Lines Changed:** ~800+ lines added/modified

---

## Breaking Changes

**None.** All features are additive and backward compatible.

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Asset Upload UI:** No progress indicator during upload (assets > 1MB may take a few seconds)
2. **Ban Notification:** Uses browser `alert()` - could be improved with toast notification
3. **Kick Permission Check:** Done client-side only - should add server-side validation for production
4. **Asset Cleanup:** Deleted shapes don't automatically delete their assets from Storage

---

## Future Enhancements

1. Add upload progress indicator for assets
2. Replace alert() with toast notification for kick/ban
3. Add server-side validation for kick permissions (Cloud Functions)
4. Implement automatic asset cleanup (orphaned assets)
5. Add asset preview thumbnails in a separate panel
6. Support video assets (MP4, WebM)
7. Add batch upload for multiple images
8. Implement asset compression before upload
