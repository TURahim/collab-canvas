### Comprehensive Code Refactoring (October 2025) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Branch:** dev  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Merged to mvp-submission  
**Files Refactored:** 19 files  

**Type Safety Improvements:**

- [x] Added `import type` for better tree-shaking (19 files)
- [x] Proper generic types for throttle/debounce
- [x] TLShapeId branded types for tldraw APIs
- [x] Fixed all TypeScript strict mode warnings

**Code Quality Enhancements:**
- [x] Removed 111 lines of duplicated code
- [x] Consolidated throttle/debounce to single source of truth
- [x] Better error handling with `instanceof Error` checks
- [x] Extracted magic numbers to named constants
- [x] Consistent naming conventions (`isMounted`, `isOnline`)

**Documentation:**
- [x] Added comprehensive JSDoc to all functions
- [x] Enhanced component documentation
- [x] Added `@param`, `@returns`, `@throws` tags
- [x] Consistent debug prefixes for console logs

**Performance Optimizations:**
- [x] Fixed `getAllShapes()` to use `getDocs()` instead of `onSnapshot`
- [x] Added proper cleanup with optional chaining (`?.()`)
- [x] Cleared pending shapes to prevent memory leaks
- [x] Dev-only console logs for production performance

**Production Readiness:**
- [x] useState for `isSyncing` to trigger UI updates
- [x] Better async safety with `isMounted` guards
- [x] Improved Firebase event handling
- [x] Nullish coalescing (`??`) for precise null handling

### Cursor Tracking Fix for tldraw v4 (October 2025) ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Branch:** dev ‚Üí mvp-submission  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed to production  
**Commit:** `19031f7` - Fix cursor tracking for tldraw v4 compatibility  

**Issue:** Cursor tracking stopped working after refactoring due to tldraw v4 API changes

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- [x] Created 23 comprehensive tests for cursor tracking
- [x] All tests passed - confirmed hook logic was correct
- [x] Identified that `editor.on("pointermove")` API no longer exists in tldraw v4
- [x] Added diagnostic logging to trace the exact issue

**Solution Implemented:**
- [x] Changed from `editor.on("pointermove")` to DOM events
- [x] Now uses `editor.getContainer().addEventListener("pointermove")`
- [x] Converts screen coordinates to page coordinates with `editor.screenToPage()`
- [x] Maintains 30Hz throttling for optimal performance
- [x] All 23 tests updated and passing

**Files Modified:**
- [x] `src/hooks/useCursors.ts` - Updated event listener implementation
- [x] `src/hooks/__tests__/useCursors.test.ts` - New comprehensive test suite (23 tests)
- [x] `src/lib/realtimeSync.ts` - Cleaned up diagnostic logging
- [x] `README.md` - Updated known issues section

**Test Results:**
- [x] 23/23 useCursors tests passing
- [x] Browser tested and verified working
- [x] Multi-user cursor tracking confirmed functional
